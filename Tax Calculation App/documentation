Tax Calculation Application
1.	Objective
The primary objective the project is to build a functioning tax calculator that can store and manage user-entered information for properties and vehicles. It must calculate tax amounts, allow users to view the summary of all stored data, and navigate through the application easily using a text-based interface.

2.	Application Flow
When the application starts, it displays a welcome screen that introduces the application name and developer details. It also gives brief instructions on how to navigate the menu. The user is then presented with the main menu, which consists of four choices:
1.	Property tax
2.	Vehicle tax
3.	Total tax
4.	Exit the application

Case 1:
If the user selects the property tax, then it shows below options:
1.	Add property details
2.	Calculate property tax
3.	Display all properties
4.	Back to main menu
If the user selects Add property details, the application asks for various property-related inputs such as built-up area, age of the land, base value, and whether the property is located in the main city. 
If the user selects 2, then application asks for property id and calculates tax using below formulas:
a)	If the property is in the main city:
•	Property tax = (built-up area × age factor × base value) + (½ × built-up area)
b)	If the property is not located in the city:
• Property tax = built-up area × age factor × base value
If the user selects 3, then application displays all the property details and if user selects 4, application returns to main menu.
Case 2:
If the user selects vehicle tax, then application shows below options:
1.	Add vehicle details
2.	Calculate vehicle tax
3.	Display all vehicles
4.	Back to main menu
If the user selects 1, the user is prompted to enter vehicle-related details such as registration number, brand, cost, capacity, maximum velocity, and fuel type.
If the user selects 2, then application asks for vehicle registration number and calculates tax using below formulas:
a)	Petrol-driven vehicles:
• Vehicle tax = velocity + capacity + 10% of the purchase cost
b)	Diesel-driven vehicles:
• Vehicle tax = velocity + capacity + 11% of the purchase cost 
c)	CNG/LPG-driven vehicles:
• Vehicle tax = velocity + capacity + 12% of the purchase cost
If the user selects 3, then application displays all the vehicle details and if user selects 4, application returns to main menu.
Case 3:
If the user selects total tax, the application displays a formatted report of all stored properties and vehicles.
Case 4:
If the user chose to exit the application, the application will end by displaying thank you message.
